Model Framing LibraryA concise, one-sentence description of what model_framing_library does.OverviewProvide a more detailed description of your library here. Explain the problem it solves and why someone would want to use it. Talk about the core concepts and design philosophy. For example:model_framing_library is a Python library designed to accelerate the initial phases of machine learning projects. It provides a structured, reusable, and extensible framework for defining data preprocessing pipelines, model architectures, and evaluation strategies. By handling the boilerplate, it allows data scientists and developers to focus on the unique aspects of their modeling tasks.Key FeaturesDeclarative Syntax: Define complex model pipelines with simple, readable configuration files or Python objects.Modular & Extensible: Easily swap out components or add custom preprocessing steps, models, and evaluation metrics.Automated Cross-Validation: Built-in support for various cross-validation strategies.Experiment Tracking: (Optional) Hooks for integrating with tools like MLflow or Weights & Biases.Framework Agnostic: Designed to work with popular libraries like Scikit-learn, PyTorch, and TensorFlow.InstallationYou can install model_framing_library directly from PyPI:pip install model_framing_library
To install the latest development version from the repository:pip install git+https://github.com/your_username/model_framing_library.git
Getting StartedHere's a quick example of how to use the library to define and run a simple modeling pipeline.1. Define your features and target:# my_frame.py
from model_framing_library import ModelFrame, Feature, Target
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

frame = ModelFrame(
    features=[
        Feature("age", dtype="numeric"),
        Feature("city", dtype="categorical"),
        Feature("income", dtype="numeric", strategy="median_fill"),
    ],
    target=Target("has_purchased", dtype="binary"),
    model=RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100),
    evaluation_metric=accuracy_score
)
2. Load your data and run the frame:import pandas as pd
from model_framing_library import run_experiment

# Load your dataset
data = pd.read_csv("path/to/your/data.csv")

# Run the experiment
result = run_experiment(frame, data)

print(f"Model Accuracy: {result.score}")
print("Feature Importance:")
for feature, importance in result.feature_importance.items():
    print(f"  - {feature}: {importance:.4f}")
